 * State: Release #1
 * Sound: SFX + Music should work

==========================================================================

2005-05-18 / 0.9.0: Shish
 * Status: LOTS of cleanups
 * menu.c: Graphical hiscore name entry works

==========================================================================


Past:

2005-05-17 / 0.8.9: Shish
 * State: SDL_shish integrated
 * Misc: Things compile nicer

2004-07-12 / 0.8.8: Shish
 * State: Yet more!
 * Misc: Hiscore support, Font support
 * menu.c: Menu instructions rendered
 * kuri2d.h: LOTS more enums
 * kuri2d.c / init.c: Score wiping (-w switch)

2004-02-28 / 0.8.7: Shish
 * State: Many maps
 * init.c: The main game loads maps from /data/levlist.dat
 * init.c / Data: /data/ reorganised

2003-10-10 / 0.8.6: Shish
 * State: More structification + Editor
 * kuri2d.h: Most of the game vars have been moved from global into
   structs for easy loading and saving
 * kuri2d.c: When run with -e <fname> the game goes into editor mode

2003-08-10 / 0.8.5: Shish
 * State: Pause!
 * game.c: The game now pauses with a press of the "p" key

2003-08-06 / 0.8.4: Shish
 * State: File IO (Sort of)
 * kuri2d.h: The levels are now loaded out of KuriLevel structs, which
   should make level editing and saving a lot easier

2003-08-04 / 0.8.3: Shish
 * State: Tweaks
 * logic.c: Got rid of the "bomb eating other bomb" bug
 * logic.c: Got rid of the "persistant trap" bug

2003-08-03 / 0.8.2: Shish
 * State: No SDL_image
 * init.c: I now *have* ripped SDL_image's loadpng function - libSDL_shish
   is 4KB bigger, but it's more portable, and SDL_image is ~30KB
 * Makefile: Hacked so it should hopefully build cleanly with
   GCC / MinGW + SDL + SDL_shish

2003-08-02 / 0.8.1: Shish
 * State: Smaller still
 * Data: The background has been separated from the other images as it's
   the least compressible part. The data files are now 350KB.
 * Data: Having cut up the images further (ie the logo is now a seperate
   file), they're now 300KB

2003-08-02 / 0.8.0: Shish
 * State: PNG?
 * init.c: libSDL_shish should soon have PNG support, so all the calls
   to SDL_LoadBMP will be replaced with SDL_LoadPNG, and data files
   changed appropriately.
 * init.c: Actually I just remembered libSDL_image, so I'm using that.
   Data files have gone from 4MB to 600KB. I may well just steal
   SDL_image's loadpng function, as that's all I need.

2003-08-01 / 0.7.5: Shish
 * Info: Some bugs fixed, broken sound code commented out

2003-07-31 / 0.7.0: Shish
 * State: Graphics
 * Data: All the backgrounds are re-done
 * Info: Sound support added (*support*, not *implementation*)

2003-07-30 / 0.6.0: Shish
 * State: Worketh
 * Info: The basic gameplay is finalized

2003-07-29 / 0.5.0: Shish
 * State: The Beta
 * Info: Much funkness, it's nearly finished!

2003-07-28 / 0.0.0: Shish
 * State: The Alpha
 * Info: Started from scratch at midnight, the alpha was finished at 6am
